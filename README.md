**OOPs (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)** :
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below : 

**Class** is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data. For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.

**Object** is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions. 


**[Collection Frameworks](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html)**

**List**
List interface implements collection interface 
List is an ordered collection it maintains the insertion order, which means upon displaying the list content it will display the elements in the same order in which  they got inserted into the list
Java List provides control over the position where you can insert an element
YOu can access elements by their index and also search elements in the list.
List allows you to add duplicate elements.
List allows you to have â€˜nullâ€™ elements
List indexes start from 0, just like arrays.
Some of the most used List implementation classes are ArrayList, LInkedList, Vector,Stack, CopyOnWriteArrayList.
