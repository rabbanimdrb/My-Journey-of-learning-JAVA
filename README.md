**OOPs (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)** :
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below : 

**Class** is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data. For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.

**Object** is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions.
